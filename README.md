1. [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for your computer’s operating system.
2. Clone this repo or download [this zip](https://github.com/octaflop/lucky_flask/archive/present.zip)
3. Install `pip` via `easy_install` (python 2)
4. To keep your python packages separated, install [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and `mkvirtualenv lucky_flask`.

## Additional Docs
